# CTAT-CTD-Hackathon
Predictive Models for Material Requirement Prediction in Supply Chain done by Ashwani and Chethiya 
This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to predict two target variables: MasterItemNo (a classification task) and QtyShipped (a regression task). The pipeline includes data loading, extensive feature engineering, model training with cross-validation, and ensembling to produce a final submission file.
