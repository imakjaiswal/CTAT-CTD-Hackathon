# CTAT-CTD-Hackathon
Predictive Models for Material Requirement Prediction in Supply Chain done by Ashwani and Chethiya. This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to predict two target variables: MasterItemNo (a classification task) and QtyShipped (a regression task). The pipeline includes data loading, extensive feature engineering, model training with cross-validation, and ensembling to produce a final submission file.

You can run the code in two ways:

#### Option A: Using Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and start Jupyter Notebook by running:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. In the browser window that opens, navigate to and open the `Code.ipynb` file.

3. Run each cell in Code.py

4. The submission.csv will be generated.
